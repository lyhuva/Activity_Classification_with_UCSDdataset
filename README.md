# Activity_Classification_with_UCSDdataset
    This is the reimplement of paper vaziman2017a. 
    I realized the Early Fusion (EF) and Late Fusion Average (LFA) and Late Fuison with weights (LFL).
    I built the LR, SVM, DT, RF and MLP models with the sklearn architecture. 
    I did LOOCV function for realizing leave each user out as testset.
    
    Hope my work can help your research and some future work. 
    Like using SVM, MLP to do some comparison, building hierarchical model for this multi-classification problem.
